'''Santiago''' &quot;'''Santi'''&quot; '''Cazorla González''' ({{IPA-es|ˈsanti kaˈθorla ɣonˈθaleθ}}; born 13 December 1984) is a Spanish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[Premier League]], and for the [[Spain national football team|Spanish national team]]. A versatile and [[ambidextrous]] [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] who can also play as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]], Cazorla is noted for his speed, shooting accuracy, capacity to change the rhythm of gameplay, and excellent close control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/especial/eurocopa/santi-cazorla.html La chispa de 'Paquirrín' (The pizazz of 'Paquirrín')]; [[El País]] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/southafrica2010/players/player=297705/profile.html|title=Santi Cazorla|publisher=FIFA.com|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ranked as the tenth-best footballer in the world by [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11667/8772182/Messi-and-Ronaldo-joined-by-Ribery-in-top-three-of-new-list-of-Europe-s-top-50-stars|title=Messi and Ronaldo joined by Ribery in top three of new list of Europe's top 50 stars|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|date=12 June 2013|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent most of the first half of his professional career with [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]], amassing [[La Liga]] totals of 253 games and 39 goals over the course of nine seasons. He also represented [[Recreativo de Huelva|Recreativo]], where he won the [[Don Balón Award|Spanish Footballer of the Year]] award for the [[2006–07 La Liga|2006–07 campaign]]. In 2012, he signed for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] from [[Málaga CF|Málaga]], quickly making an impact in the first team in his [[2012–13 Arsenal F.C. season|first year]] at the club with 13 [[Assist (football)|assists]], after which he was voted Arsenal Player of the Season.

Cazorla represented [[Spain national football team|Spain]] at [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]], winning both tournaments, and has gained more than 70 [[Cap (sport)|caps]]. He has also played at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==

===Villarreal===
Born in [[Llanera, Asturias]], Cazorla started playing club football for local team [[Real Oviedo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archivo.lavozdeasturias.es/html/429720.html|title=Santi Cazorla: El más listo de la clase|trans_title=Santi Cazorla: Brightest pupil in class|publisher=La Voz de Asturias|language=Spanish|date=1 July 2008|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; being acquired by [[Villarreal CF]] six months before turning 18, as his previous club, immersed in a deep financial crisis, suffered two relegations at the end of the [[2002–03 Segunda División|2002–03 season]] which saw it land in [[Tercera División]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lne.es/deportes/2011/07/22/rebollo-regresa-oviedo/1106095.html|title=Rebollo regresa al Oviedo|trans_title=Rebollo returns to Oviedo|publisher=[[La Nueva España]]|language=Spanish|date=22 July 2011|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then progressed through [[Villarreal CF B|the reserve side]], making his debut with the first team on 30 November 2003 in a 1–0 win at [[Deportivo de La Coruña]] (one minute played).

Established in the main squad in the 2004–05 campaign, Cazorla scored four goals in [[2004–05 UEFA Cup|the season]]'s [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], also making two goalless appearances in [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League|the following season]]'s [[UEFA Champions League]].

===Recreativo===
On 7 July 2006 [[Recreativo de Huelva]] signed Cazorla for [[Euro|€]]600,000 on a four-year deal, with a clause in his contract whereby he could return to Villarreal (for €1.2 million),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recreativohuelva.com/pag/noticias_detalle.asp?offset=1800&amp;idnoticias=3315|title=Santi Cazorla será presentado este lunes|trans_title=Santi Cazorla will be presented Monday|publisher=[[Recreativo de Huelva]]|language=Spanish|date=15 July 2006|accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; going on to score in his official debut, a 1–1 home draw with [[RCD Mallorca]], on 27 August. He became Spanish Player of the Year according to ''[[Don Balón]]'', a member of [[European Sports Magazines]] after topping its rating list;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donbalon.com/front/default.asp?OPT=RER&amp;RERID=1964|title=Don Balón Rankings 2006–2007|publisher=[[Don Balón]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=20 June 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071106222027/http://www.donbalon.com/front/default.asp?OPT=RER&amp;RERID=1964 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 22 April 2007 he dedicated a goal to his father who had died recently, in a 4–2 home win against [[Racing de Santander]], going on to help the [[Andalusia]]ns, which had just [[2005–06 Segunda División|returned]] from [[Segunda División]], eventually [[2006–07 La Liga|finish eighth]].

===Return to Villarreal===
The following year, Villarreal took advantage of the clause in Cazorla's contract and bought him back, as the team believed he had proven himself. In [[2007–08 La Liga|his first season in his second spell]], he was instrumental in Villarreal's final runner-up placing, providing [[Assist (football)|assists]] for [[Nihat Kahveci]] and [[Giuseppe Rossi]] and netting five goals himself.

On 26 August 2008, Cazorla announced that [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] were interested in signing him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setantasports.com/en/Sport/News/Football/2008/08/26/Liga-Cazorla-on-Madrid/?facets/sport-space/great-britain-locale/football/ Cazorla: Madrid want to sign me]; Setanta Sports&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on to cause a stir in the media by rejecting the team announcing that, &quot;There are many other things in football besides Real Madrid. It's clear that it is possible to say &quot;no&quot; to them, There is no doubt that they are a great team, but I also feel very satisfied and valued at my club&quot;. &quot;I hope I can continue growing at Villarreal because I am young and I’m only starting off with the national team.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goal.com/en/articolo.aspx?contenutoid=857173 It's possible to say ‘No’ to Madrid]; Goal.com&lt;/ref&gt;

During a league game against [[UD Almería]] in early April 2009, Cazorla injured his right [[fibula]] after suffering a challenge from two opponents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=816561.html Villarreal rocked by Cazorla injury]; UEFA.com, 4 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He missed several games but ''el Submarino Amarillo'' still managed to [[2008–09 La Liga|qualify for the Europa League]], as the player made his comeback earlier than expected in the side's final match, a 3–2 win at [[RCD Mallorca]], and finished the league campaign with a career-best eight goals.

Cazorla struggled heavily with injury in the [[2009–10 La Liga|2009–10 season]],&lt;ref name=&quot;HERNIA&quot;&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2010-02-03-621816192_x.htm Cazorla has hernia operation, out 5–6 weeks]; [[USA Today]], 2 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcomercio.es/v/20110606/deportes/futbol/cazorla-espalda-contratiempos-20110606.html Cazorla da la espalda a los contratiempos (Cazorla turns back on setbacks)]; El Comercio, 6 June 2011 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; going on to miss the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8695232.stm Spain omit Marcos Senna from 2010 World Cup squad]; [[BBC Sport]], 20 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to full fitness in [[2010–11 La Liga|the following campaign]], only missing one game and scoring five times as Villarreal finished fourth and [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|qualified to the Champions League]].

===Málaga===
On 26 July 2011 Cazorla left Villarreal and returned to [[Andalusia]] to join high-spending [[Málaga CF|Málaga]], for a fee of €21 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/937505/winger-santi-cazorla-set-to-join-malaga-revolution?cc=5901 Cazorla: Malaga move close]; [[ESPN Soccernet]], 26 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/soccer/07/26/malaga.cazorla.ap/index.html Malaga signs Santi Cazorla from Villarreal]; [[Sports Illustrated]], 26 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He scored on his official debut on 28 August, netting from a superbly taken [[Direct free kick|free kick]] but in a 1–2 away loss against neighbouring [[Sevilla FC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/324014?cc=5739 Sevilla see off Malaga]; ESPN Soccernet, 28 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 September he scored a brace and gave an assist in another [[local derby]], a 4–0 home win against [[Granada CF]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/327701?cc=5739|title=Malaga ease to victory|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=12 September 2011|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and netted his fourth in only four games nine days later – again from a free kick – in a 1–0 home success over [[Athletic Bilbao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/323985?cc=5739|title=Cazorla nets winner|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=21 September 2011|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2012, Cazorla scored from an injury-time free kick in a 1–1 away draw against Real Madrid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/marcador/futbol/2011_12/primera/jornada_28/rma_mga/|title=Cazorla manda callar al Bernabéu|trans_title=Cazorla silences Bernabéu|publisher=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|language=Spanish|date=18 March 2012|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finished [[2011–12 La Liga|the season]] as the team's second top scorer (only behind [[José Salomón Rondón|Salomón Rondón]]) as they finished fourth and [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League|qualified for the Champions League]] for the first time in the club's history.

===Arsenal===
On 7 August 2012, it was officially announced that Cazorla had signed a long-term deal with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/arsenal-sign-spain-midfielder-santi-cazorla|title=Arsenal sign Spain midfielder Santi Cazorla|publisher=Arsenal F.C.|date=7 August 2012|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became [[Arsène Wenger]]'s third major signing of the summer after the arrivals of German attacker [[Lukas Podolski]] and French striker [[Olivier Giroud]].

====2012–13 season====
Cazorla made an exciting start to his Arsenal career, picking up the man of the match award on his debut for the club against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. The Spain international scored for his national side in a friendly win over [[Puerto Rico national football team|Puerto Rico]] and followed that with another accomplished display at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]]. &quot;Every day I’m becoming more used to [my team-mates] and I'm enjoying myself more,&quot; he said. &quot;The club have done a lot to help me settle in the team and to make it easy for me to get used to life in the city. Every day is a little bit better and I feel a little more comfortable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla|title=Cazorla shines in Arsenal debut|publisher=Arsenal FC|date = 19 August 2012|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flickr - Ronnie Macdonald - Santi Cazorla 2.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Cazorla taking a [[Corner kick|corner]] for Arsenal]]

Cazorla continued his impressive start to life at Arsenal with a series of sparkling performances in September. The Spanish playmaker grabbed his first goal for the club in a 2–0 win against Liverpool at Anfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla|title=Cazorla relishing in Arsenal form|publisher=Arsenal FC|date = 22 September 2012|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cazorla made five appearances over October, scoring once with a blockbuster against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]] that won the Arsenal's Goal of the Month award. The Spaniard drew praise from manager [[Arsène Wenger]] after that game, stating: “He is right footed but when you watch him play you don’t know. It shows how important that is in the modern midfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla|title=Cazorla goal noticed by Wenger|publisher=Arsenal FC|date = 29 October 2012|accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santi was an ever-present figure throughout November, starting in every one of Arsenal’s fixtures. The playmaker scored a consolation at Old Trafford and, like Lukas Podolski and Olivier Giroud, scored in his first [[North London Derby]] appearance, where he was also named man of the match. “I feel valued here,” he told Arsenal in an interview. “The manager gives me confidence, and within the team I have a responsibility that I love having. Little by little, I hope to keep improving and I hope to help the team as much as possible.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla|title=Cazorla consolation goal nothing compared to maiden derby goal|publisher=Arsenal FC|date = 29 November 2012|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santi played in every game except the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] defeat to [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] in December. The Spanish playmaker scored his first hat-trick for the club against Reading, a performance that saw him pick up another man of the match award. &quot;It’s a pleasure for anyone to play with a player like Santi,&quot; [[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain]] told Arsenal in an interview. &quot;You can give him the ball in tight situations and you can trust him to get out of them and create things. We’ve been working on getting him and [[Jack Wilshere|Jack]] [Wilshere] in behind the lines, between the defence and the midfield and picking up little pockets of space. When you get the ball to them two in those positions, especially Santi, he can create things—shots on target, goals and assists.” Despite a so far successful campaign, Cazorla was mired in controversy during the match against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], as he earned a [[Penalty kick|penalty]] upon apparently being tripped by [[Steven Reid]], which was converted to make it 1–0 in an eventual 2–0 home success. However, television replays showed that there had been no contact between Reid and Cazorla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2244563/Arsenal-2-West-Brom-0--Match-report.html|title=Arsenal 2 West Brom 0: Santi proves he's no saint as Spaniard goes down easily to earn a dubious penalty for Arteta to convert|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|last=Collins|first=Patrick|date=10 December 2012|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to Wenger issuing an apology for Cazorla being awarded a penalty and suggesting that the Spaniard could face disciplinary action for going to ground too easily; the manager also revealed that the playmaker had told him that he &quot;was touched, lost his balance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/183055.html|title=Wenger sorry for Cazorla dive|publisher=ESPN FC|date=10 December 2012|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santi maintained his record of playing in all of the club’s Premier League games this season and scored against West Ham with an audacious backheel. The playmaker was also deployed in both FA Cup games against Swansea City in January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla|title=Cazorla scores amazing goal and continues personal record|publisher=Arsenal FC|date = 29 January 2013|accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cazorla enjoyed a fruitful February, scoring the winner in a man of the match display against Sunderland before also securing victory against Aston Villa with a brace. The Spaniard appeared in all of Arsenal’s fixtures and is still the only member of manager Arsène Wenger’s squad to have featured in every Premier League fixture this season. “You see he takes his chances with his technique and his feeling,” Per Mertesacker told Arsenal. “He is the perfect footballer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla|title=Cazorla enjoys praise from performances|publisher=Arsenal FC|date = 25 February 2013|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santi was still the only Arsenal player to have featured in every Premier League game this season after playing every minute of Arsenal’s March fixtures. An impressive performance against Swansea saw him named man of the match for another time, before he finished the month in style by netting in the 4–1 win against Reading at Emirates Stadium. “For any footballer, it’s the most important thing to make the people who support you happy and give back to them on the pitch,” Santi said on his positive relationship with the Arsenal’s fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla|title=Cazorla enjoys praise from performances|publisher=Arsenal FC|date = 26 March 2013|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santi continued his record of being the only Arsenal player to feature in every Premier League game in the 2012/13 season after starting every game during April. &quot;What I’ve taken from this year is that as a team, we weren't very consistent for half of the season, which cost us in terms of reaching the higher positions in the league,&quot; he told Arsenal. &quot;Now we’re a lot more consistent and that’s the form we were lacking before—being consistent and getting the three points whenever we could. We’re a long way off the top because of this lack of form, even though it was only for half the season.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla|title=Cazorla talks about what could've been|publisher=Arsenal FC|date = 26 March 2013|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May 2013, Cazorla assisted all four of Arsenal's goals, in a vital 4–1 win over [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] which relegated their opponents and kept the Gunners in fourth place, with the eventual [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|qualification to the Champions League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22430454|title=Arsenal 4–1 Wigan|publisher=BBC Sport|last=McKenna|first=Chris|date=14 May 2013|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cazorla finished an exceptional first season in England as the only Arsenal player to feature in all 38 league games, and on 31 May 2013, he was named Arsenal's Player of the Season for [[2012–13 Arsenal F.C. season|2012–13]].&lt;ref name=pots&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/player-of-the-season-1st-cazorla|title=Player of the Season: 1st Cazorla|date=31 May 2013|accessdate=9 March 2013|work=Arsenal F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended his first season at Arsenal with 12 goals and 14 assists from 49 appearances.&lt;ref name=pots/&gt; “I think he is a bit of an underrated player in the Premier League,” Arsène Wenger told Arsenal. “When you think he was not in the [PFA] team of the season picked by the players, it's quite harsh. Personally I would have put him in there.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla|title=Wenger says Cazorla is &quot;underrated&quot;|publisher=Arsenal FC|date = 14 May 2013|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013–14 season====
[[File:Santi Cazorla v Sunderland - 22 Feb 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Cazorla preparing to take a corner against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in a Premier League match on 22 February 2014.]]
Cazorla returned to pre-season training a few weeks later than normal after his involvement in the [[2013 Confederations Cup|Confederations Cup]] for [[Spanish national football team|Spain]]. He started from the bench against Aston Villa but was introduced at half-time after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's injury. He played in every minute of Arsenal's games after that and played an important part in the side's three straight wins early on in the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cazorla returns to pre season and plays important part for Arsenal |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla |work=Arsenal FC |date=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santi's only appearance came against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hostpur]] in September. The Spaniard picked up an ankle injury before the Sunderland game that kept him out of action for the rest of the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cazorla injured in Sunderland game |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla |work=Arsenal FC |date=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cazorla returned to the team after missing the majority of Arsenal's September games with an ankle injury. The Spanish playmaker started the game against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] and was involved in the build-up to Jack Wilshere's stunning goal in the first half. He came on as a substitute in the defeat at home to [[Borussia Dortmund]] and his introduction seemed to swing the momentum towards Arsenal before [[Robert Lewandowski]]'s late winner for the German side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cazorla features in Arsenal games in late September|url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla |work=Arsenal FC |date=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cazorla featured in all six of Arsenal's games in November and scored his first goal of the season with an expertly-taken effort against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. The Spaniard, along with Mesut Özil, operated mostly from the flanks but due to the flexibility of Arsenal's midfield, was able to drift inside and cause problems for opposition defences with his passing ability. &quot;I feel comfortable playing on the left flank&quot; Cazorla said. &quot;Starting on the left is fine as long as I have the freedom to move on the pitch. The main difference is the way you play when the opponent has possession. As soon as we get the ball back, Mesut [Özi] Jack [Wilshere] or myself are free to change positions, however as soon as we give the ball away, we have certain duties to fulfil.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cazorla starts in every game and reaps rewards |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla |work=Arsenal FC |date=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 November 2013, Cazorla made his 300th career top-flight league appearance, when he started for Arsenal in a 3–0 win against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].

Cazorla started the first three games in December before being rested against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. The Spaniard returned to the side for the win over West Ham United, when he produced a bright performance and provided the pass for Theo Walcott's equalising goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cazorla returns to Arsenal set up in December |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla |work=Arsenal FC |date=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cazorla produced a string of sparkling performances in January. The Spanish playmaker thumped home Arsenal's first against Tottenham Hotspur, before scoring an eye-catching brace in the win at home to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. The goals kept coming for the 29-year-old with further strikes against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cazorla's amazing performances in January too much for opponents |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla |work=Arsenal FC |date=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking after the win over Spurs, Cazorla said: &quot;We played really well as a team. Tottenham have some good players but we played at a good level and we just need to continue that now.&quot; With his impressive January form, Cazorla was voted Arsenal's Player of the Month, scoring five goals in six matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/51130/cazorla-wins-player-of-the-month|title=Cazorla wins Player of the Month|date=5 February 2014|accessdate=6 February 2014|work=Arsenal FC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cazorla continued his good form in February. The Spaniard provided an exquisite pass for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's first goal against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. He went on to start four more times for the Gunners during the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cazorla form continues in February |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla |work=Arsenal FC |date=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cazorla played completed every minute of Arsenal's seven fixtures in March and committed his long-term future to Arsenal by signing a new contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cazorla, Ramsey, Zelalem sign new contracts |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/20140318/cazorla-ramsey-zelalem-sign-contracts |work=Arsenal FC |date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spaniard produced bright performances in the games against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], Tottenham and Manchester City but struggled to make an impact in the disappointing defeats to Stoke City and Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cazorla struggles in defeats to Stoke and Chelsea |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla |work=Arsenal FC |date=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I'm very happy at the club, being able to stay here and sign [a new] contract – it's great to get it sorted,” Cazorla said. &quot;I like being here, I'm happy and I think that the club can be a big player in competing for the top trophies in years to come. That's important for me. &quot;One of the main reasons for coming here was to get better as a player and joining Arsenal has definitely made me a better player.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cazorla sends Arsenal home in April |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla |work=Arsenal FC |date=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a disappointing start to April against Everton, Cazorla tucked home the winning penalty in the shootout against [[Wigan Athletic]]  to send Arsenal to the final of the [[2013–14 FA Cup|FA Cup]] at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26897266|title=Arsenal 1–1 Wigan|date=12 April 2014|accessdate=18 May 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also provided assists for three more Arsenal goals in April and showed his versatility throughout the month by playing on both wings and just behind the striker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cazorla sends Arsenal home in April |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla |work=Arsenal FC |date=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spaniard also added to his assist tally when his corner was headed home by Olivier Giroud against West Brom and scored Arsenal's first goal – a direct free-kick – as the team came from 2–0 down to defeat [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] 3–2 in the [[2014 FA Cup Final]], winning his first piece of silverware with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27354148|title=Arsenal 3–2 Hull|date=17 May 2014|accessdate=18 May 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the campaign with seven goals and 47 appearances in all competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla|title=Cazorla finishes season on a high|date=30 May 2014|accessdate=31 May 2014|work=Arsenal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cazorla began the campaign with another goal at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]], slotting home Arsenal's opener against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in the [[2014 FA Community Shield]]. The win against the defending Premier League champions gave Arsenal their second title in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/english-fa-community-shield/story/1979883/arsenal-beat-manchester-city-in-community-shield |title=Arsenal beat City in Community Shield |publisher=ESPNFC |date=10 August 2014 |accessdate=10 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spaniard also set up [[Aaron Ramsey]]'s goal against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] with a low cross and was also involved in [[Alexis Sánchez]]'s strike against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. The 29-year-old has also revealed his personal targets for the season, telling Arsenal: “I hope to equal or beat my goalscoring tally from last year,” he said. “That's something every player wants to achieve. Hopefully I'll help the team with many goals because that would be a signal that I can be useful. Apart from that, I'd like to play as much as possible. Luckily the manager has always trusted me in the previous two years. I played a good number of games and hopefully I'll keep doing so.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/santi-cazorla |title=Cazorla reveals personal targets for 2014/15 |publisher=Arsenal |date=31 August 2014 |accessdate=31 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 November, he assisted both [[Yaya Sanogo]] and Sánchez in 2–0 win against [[Borussia Dortmund]] in the Champions League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29363037|title=Arsenal 2–0 Borussia Dortmund|work=BBC Sport|date=26 November 2014|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 28 December, he scored the opening goal in an away match against West Ham in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30566743|title=West Ham United 1-2 Arsenal|work=BBC Sport|date=28 December 2014|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 January he assisted Sánchez for the second goal in a 2–0 win against Hull City in the FA Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30614334|title=Arsenal 2-0 Hull City|work=BBC Sport|date=4 January 2015|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spaniard added to his goal tally on 18 January in a 2-0 away win against holding Premier League champions Manchester City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30766356|title=Manchester City 0–2 Arsenal|work=BBC Sport|date=18 January 2015|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cazorla was instrumental in the home game against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in the Premier League as he scored from the penalty spot and assisted goals to [[Theo Walcott]] and fellow countryman [[Hector Bellerin]] in a 5-0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30971833|title=Arsenal 5-0 Aston Villa|work=BBC Sport|date=1 February 2015|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 21, he scored the opening goal away to Crystal Palace in a 2-1 Premier League win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29363037|title=Crystal Palace 1–2 Arsenal|work=BBC Sport|date=21 February 2015|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May 2015, Cazorla was selected to start in the [[2015 FA Cup Final]], playing the full 90 minutes and being voted man of the match in a 4–0 defeat of Aston Villa at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/live/football/32563518|title=FA Cup final - FT: Arsenal 4-0 Villa|date=30 May 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Santiago Cazorla - Spain vs. Chile, 10th September 2013.jpg|thumb|Cazorla playing in a friendly against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] in September 2013]]
Cazorla began his international career in the [[Spain national under-21 football team|Spanish under-21 team]], under [[Iñaki Sáez]]. He was called up for play-off games against [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy]] for the [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]],&lt;ref&gt; Despite his club football success, Cazorla has struggled to start regularly for Spain during their illustrious and highly successful run under Vicente del Bosque.[http://www.uefa.com/under21/news/newsid=465541.html Sáez seeking Spanish advance]; UEFA.com&lt;/ref&gt; playing the first match which ended 0–1 – coming in on the 77th minute for [[Javier Arizmendi]] – but missing the second leg as the nation did not eventually qualify for the competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2006/10/10/futbol/1160511434.html El fútbol español vuelve a quedarse fuera de los JJOO (Spanish football once again out of Olympic Games)]; [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]], 10 October 2006 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 May 2008, [[Spain national football team|senior side]] boss [[Luis Aragonés]] surprised the Spanish press by including the [[Cap (sport)|uncapped]] Cazorla and [[Sergio García de la Fuente|Sergio García]] in his [[UEFA Euro 2008]] squad, over more established wingers such as [[Joaquín Sánchez]] and [[Albert Riera]]. However, Riera not playing much at the time &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2008/0517/spain.html Raul omitted from Spanish squad]; RTÉ Sport, 17 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; To justify his decision when asked, Aragonés stated, &quot;They are players [''Cazorla and García''] who are performing very well and had the possibility of coming. I made myself decide between Riera and Cazorla where I considered each player's form&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eldia.es/2008-05-18/jornada/jornada38.htm Sergio García y Santi Cazorla, las sorpresas de la selección nacional (S.García and S.Cazorla, national team callup surprises)]; El Día, 18 May 2008 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was summoned for [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup|the following year]]'s [[FIFA Confederations Cup]], where he made a couple of substitute appearances.

After missing the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] due to a [[hernia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;HERNIA&quot;/&gt; Cazorla returned to the national team's setup. On 4 June 2011, during the first half of a friendly against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] in [[Foxboro, Massachusetts|Foxboro]], he scored twice in a 4–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbssports.com/general/story/15199301/playing-without-donovan-us-shut-out-by-spain/rss Playing without Donovan, U.S. shut out by Spain]; [[CBS Sports]], 4 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Cazorla was selected by [[Vicente del Bosque]] for the [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] tournament in [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]]. He played ten minutes against [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] (4–0 group stage win)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/matches/round=15172/match=2003332/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Spain turn on style to eliminate Ireland|publisher=UEFA.com|date=14 June 2012|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and six against [[France national football team|France]] (2–0, quarterfinals)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/matches/round=15173/match=2003345/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Centurion Alonso sends Spain into last four|publisher=UEFA.com|date=23 June 2012|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the eventual champions.
